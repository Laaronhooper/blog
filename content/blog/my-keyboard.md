## The journey away from QWERTY

Crack. I broke my thumb. And just like that I was typing one handed.

If you know anything about QWERTY you know it as the default standard for
keyboards. Developed in the 19th century, QWERTY was designed for mechanical
typewriters, aiming to reduce jams by spacing out commonly used letters. Or at
least thats how the story goes.

The primary issue with QWERTY is its inefficient letter placement. Studies have
shown that this layout requires more finger motion, movement and isn't friendly
to bi-grams. This and my month of typing one handed lead me away from QWERTY.

## The options

1. Dvorak Simplified Keyboard: Designed to increase typing speed and reduce
   finger fatigue. It places the most commonly used letters on the home row.
2. Colemak: A modern adaptation that changes fewer keys from QWERTY (17 compared
   to Dvorak's 33), making it easier to learn. It focuses on typing efficiency
   and comfort.
3. Workman: Created with an emphasis on minimizing finger movement and
   accounting for the different lengths of fingers.

## My thought process

I knew that I wanted, if not needed to change my layout. And having not learnt
to touch type yet I knew that this would be a great opportunity too. I wanted to
be as efficient as I possibly could be.

I did already have some keys ingrained in memory. The classic CMD-Z, CMD-C,
CMD-V and CMD-Q. So I was hoping to keep some of these pre-existing key
combinations. So this immediately ruled out Dvorak. And though workman kept
some, I wanted to find a balance between keeping as much of QWERTY as I can (so
to persist my QWERTY knowledge). This made me settle on Colemak, Colemak-dh to
be accurate.
